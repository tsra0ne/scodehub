# Introduction to SwiftUI

## What is SwiftUI?

SwiftUI, UI stands for User Interface is a framework developed by apple for creating the screens on an app for any apple platform. Whether its an iPhone, iPad, AppleTV, Apple Watch or a Mac Book. You can create apps on all these platforms using SwiftUI.

## SwiftUI vs UIKit

Some of you who are just starting out might not even know that there are two options to build user interface, but these are both UI frameworks developed by apple for creating iOS applications. You can build the exact same app using UIKit or SwiftUI but the underlying code that you're going to write are totally different. So it is important which UI framwork you want to use for your app. As it stands today it is important to know both frameworks. SwiftUI is much easier to learn and it's also much faster to implement.
